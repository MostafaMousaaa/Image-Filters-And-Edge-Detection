//  Assignment 1 (Filtration & edge detection)
//  UI & Read RGB and gray images (opencv)                      Mostafa Mousa
//  1- Add additive noise to the image (opencv)             Mostafa Mousa
//  - For example: Uniform, Gaussian and salt & pepper noise.
//  2- Filter the noisy image using the following low pass filters.
//  -Average, Gaussian and median filters.
//  3- Detect edges in the image using the following masks
//  -Sobel , Roberts , Prewitt and Canny edge detectors. (Use opencv for canny only for task 1, Edge
//  detection preview in x and y directions except for canny)
//  4- Draw histogram and distribution curve                  Mostafa Mousa
//  5- Equalize the image.
//  6- Normalize the image.
//  7- Local and global thresholding. (Use any thresholding method)
//  8- Transformation from color image to gray scale image and plot of R, G, and B histograms with its
//  distribution function (cumulative curve that you use it for mapping and histogram equalization).
//  9- Frequency domain filters (high pass and low pass).
//  10- Hybrid images.                    Mostafa Mousa
//  B) Report all of the above to TAâ€™s (One Zip file including report, codes, results, etc)
//  ( Report has all your observation on different results from different methods and parameters
//  variations and task algorithms integrated with UI to test them)           Mostafa Mousa
