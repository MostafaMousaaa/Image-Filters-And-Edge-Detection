// # Assignment 2: Edge and boundary detection (Hough transform and SNAKE)
// #  For given images (grayscale and color)/you may run on other images
// #  A) Tasks to implement
// #  For all given images; detect edges using Canny edge detector, detect lines, circles, 
// # ellipsed located in these images (if any). Superimpose the detected shapes on the 
// # images.
// #  For given images; initialize the contour for a given object and evolve the Active 
// # Contour Model (snake) using the greedy algorithm. Represent the output as chain 
// # code and compute the perimeter and the area inside these contours.
